# Large Hashcat Rules

This repo contains various files that are amalgamations of various popular .rules files. 

Size order from smallest -> largest: Onerule2020, OneHobo, mega, giga, infinium

## Usage

Don't, everything here except possibly Onerule2020 and (less) possibly giga are worse than what Unic0rn28 has made at https://github.com/Unic0rn28/hashcat-rules

Onerule2020 is a good replacement for onerule that's only slightly larger, onehobo is a combination of the two rulesets in its name. These can be goto rulesets. mega maybe as well if you have patience. giga is great for recursive testing or anything where you'll have a small wordlist. Not sure if the return on investment for infinium is really there, at that point you may be better off generating random hashcat rules.
